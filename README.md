# DATA SCIENCE ANALYTIC WITH DASH PYTHON FRAMEWORK

## Instalation : 

pip install dash

This also brings along the plotly graphing library. This library is under active development, so install and upgrade frequently.

If you prefer Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab as your development environment, we recommend installing jupyter-dash:

pip install jupyter-dash

These docs are running dash version 2.7.0.

This version supports Python 3. Versions of dash before 2.0.0 also supported Python 2.

We also recommend installing Pandas, which is required by Plotly Express and used in many of our examples.

pip install pandas


## Running : python3 visualization.py
